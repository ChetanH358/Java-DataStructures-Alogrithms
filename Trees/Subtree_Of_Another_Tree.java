 * A given subtree (root, left ,right) -> (1 , 2, 3) .
 * we need to check weather the given tree is subtree of an existing tree or not
 * Approach :-
 * 1) compare the root node of subtree and existing tree
 * 2) if true, then compare its left node . if left is also correct then compare its right node
 * 3) if all three nodes are matched correctly then retrun. the tree is subtree of existing tree
